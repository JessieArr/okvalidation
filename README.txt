OK-Valid's Mission Statement:

1- To provide Javascript validation with a minimum of markup and Javascript code.
2- To provide a robust suite of default behavior that can be used out-of-the-box with little markup and no JS needed.
3- To allow default behavior to be overridden as needed.
4- To provide hooks and callbacks that allow complex behavior to be achieved in a clean manner.
5- To make calls to OK Validate as close to plain language as possible: onclick="OKValidate(this).then(doSomeWork)"
6- To allow validation to not just be element-bound, but also scoped to DOM subtrees and classes if desired. If every 
	input field in a div is required, then we can set the required validation attribute on the div itself and its 
	children will inherit it.
7- To have no dependency on any other external libraries. (No, not even jQuery)
